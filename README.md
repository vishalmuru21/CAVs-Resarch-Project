In the Fall 2023 Semester, I engaged in a project at the Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems at Mississippi State University, 
a leading technology development center renowned for addressing intricate challenges in fields like autonomous vehicles and human-machine interaction. 
Collaborating closely with my Computer Science professor, 
our research focused on employing machine learning and Deep Learning techniques for Semantic Navigation in Off-road Autonomous Driving to identify traversable paths. 
The project utilized sophisticated deep learning-based 3D semantic reasoning tools using Pytorch, and we successfully completed the project.
